# AppXchange
AppXchange is a user-friendly webstore using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and Stripe for payment processing. Current features include a secure login and logout system using passportJS and bcrypt, a checkout system using the Stripe API and a my orders page where logged in users can view their previous orders and order status.

Tech stack: I am using React.js, HTML, CSS and Javascript on the front-end. For the back-end I am using Node.js with Express hosted on Heroku.
